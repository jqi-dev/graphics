  Every graphic must have an outer wrapper with an id of "graphics-environment."
  This is what the Atlas code looks for when it loads a graphics asset.

<div id="graphics-environment">

<!--
  Every graphic must have a UNIQUE ID, specified here and used in js/main.js.
  The module code must self-scope down and only access elements inside this
  container <div> so that they don't accidentally modify another graphic on an
  Atlas entry.

  Put your graphics HTML in here. You can include images with any relative path
  you want, as long as they live under the /graphics/skeleton/ directory.

  You must include the following <script> tag so that the graphic will run
  outside of the Atlas environment. The Atlas loader will actually strip this
  tag away and execute main.js separately.
